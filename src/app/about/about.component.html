          <br> This all started around a large, rectangular, white table in the software egineering room in the CSE
          <br> Department at UNT. Four students — Lupe Rivera, Stephen Ho, James Arnold, and AnneMarie Sabatini
          <br> — gathered around, feasted on mango monster energy drinks as we contemplated upon what we should
          <br> do to contribute to our society. Being college students, colloquially poor people, we understood the
          <br> struggle of trying to eat healthy and also cheaply. Thus, NutriNovel was born: a quick and easy way to
          <br> access  various nutrition information about fast food.
