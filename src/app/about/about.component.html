          <br> This all started around a large, rectangular, white table in the software
          <br> egineering room in the CSE Department at UNT. Four students —
          <br> Lupe Rivera, Stephen Ho, Nolan Arnold, and AnneMarie Sabatini —
          <br> gathered around, feasted on mango monster energy drinks as we
          <br> contemplated upon what we should do to contribute to our society. Being
          <br> college students, colloquially poor people, we understood the #struggle of
          <br> trying to eat healthy and also cheaply. Thus, NutriNovel was born:
          <br> a quick and easy way to access various nutrition information about
          <br> fast food.
