          <br> This all started around a large, rectangular, white table in the software egineering room in the CSE
          <br> Department at UNT. Four students — Lupe Rivera, Stephen Ho, Nolan Arnold, and AnneMarie Sabatini
          <br> — gathered around, feasted on mango monster energy drinks as we contemplated upon what we should do
          <br> to contribute to our society. Being college students, colloquially poor people, we understood the struggle
          <br> of trying to eat healthy and also cheaply. Thus, NutriNovel was born: a quick and easy way to access
          <br> various nutrition information about fast food.
