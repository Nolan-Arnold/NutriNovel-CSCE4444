          <span> This all started around a large, rectangular, white table in the software egineering room in the CSE</span>
          <span> Department at UNT. Four students — Lupe Rivera, Stephen Ho, James Arnold, and AnneMarie Sabatini</span>
          <span> — gathered around, feasted on mango monster energy drinks as we contemplated upon what we should</span>
          <span> do to contribute to our society. Being college students, colloquially poor people, we understood the</span>
          <span> struggle of trying to eat healthy and also cheaply. Thus, NutriNovel was born: a quick and easy way to</span>
          <span> access  various nutrition information about fast food.</span>
